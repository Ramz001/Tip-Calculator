# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview
  This is a pretty interesting calculator in which the money is counted
  depeding on the amount of bill , number of people (divided for each member) 
  and percentage of tip that is required in a particular case.
  

### The challenge

This project was not especially puzzling and took around 7 hours to complete in 
addition to debug a few times .

The hardest part of this challenge was to connect the design template and the js
file of the project that accounts for all logics inside.

## My process

To begin with,I started by creating files and installing tailwind , then I declared
some custom variables in the config file of tailwindcss so that I could use custom font and colour
Then, I started creating html template of this project assigning each text to the type of html element
div, input, label and so on .It took roughly 40 minutes to complete. After creating the skeleton of my
website I started designing it in accordance with the design given by frontend mentor.
The process was undeniably faster than just with a plain css and took much less time to debug
and did not cause any frustration in most cases.The whole designing process took around 
3 hours to complete and then I moved on to create the logic of my website .
At first , I was a little confused as I did not know where to start than I came across 
a video where the author of that video created a similar project that I used as a sample 
After that I started coding it  and dubugging in the process I assume it took roughly 3 hours
to complete with the logical side and at the end I checked the responsiveness and did some further dubugging so that the website logic is solid and reliable .
To sum up , it was pretty fun to do as I learned how to connect html and css template 
of a website with js in a practical way.
